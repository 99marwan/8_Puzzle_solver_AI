## Assumptions and Details
● Once the given initial state is solved, the user can click on
the ‘Next’ button to see the next state in the solution and
the ‘Previous’ button to see the previous state. Once the
user reaches the goal state, the buttons are disabled.__
● Assuming the starting algorithm will be DFS if the user
didn’t change it

## **Manhattan Vs Euclidean**
After reviewing the table shown above and comparing the
Manhattan heuristic and the Euclidean heuristic, it appears
that the Manhattan heuristic expands less nodes and has a
shorter running time in general. This aligns with the
hypothesis that Manhattan heuristic would be better as the
heuristic is a better model of how moves are made in the
8-puzzle. In conclusion, Manhattan Distance is a more
admissible heuristic than Euclidean Distance.
